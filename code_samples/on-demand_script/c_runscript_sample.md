# Sample RunScript Code

Once uploaded, you can call an on-demand product script at any time. For example, once a client activates your Data Connectors integration, you might want to request a Analytics report at regular intervals to evaluate clientâ€™s use of your services and identify ways to improve client results.

The following scripts use [Partner.RunScript](../../Genesis_API/integration_api/r_runScript.md#) to call the on-demand product scripts described in [On-Demand Product Script](c_ondemand_product_script.md#).

**Note:** Once you have uploaded the desired product scripts, you can automate on-demand script usage by creating an application that makes the [Partner.RunScript](../../Genesis_API/integration_api/r_runScript.md#) calls at regular intervals.

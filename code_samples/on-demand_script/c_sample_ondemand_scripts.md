# Sample On-Demand Script Usage

These code samples illustrate the use of on-demand scripts to generate a Analytics report.

The Data Connectors Partner API lets you include on-demand product scripts as part of your Data Connectors integration. On-demand product scripts let you use the Web Services APIs, such as the Analytics Reporting API, at any time to gather data relevant to a client’s integration. You can use this data as feedback to help improve a client’s service over time, or to identify additional services that might benefit the client.

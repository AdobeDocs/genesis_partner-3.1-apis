# Implementation

The following process, used to create the Twitter sample integration, serves as a general model for creating integrations of any type using the Data Connectors Partner APIs

**[Create the Data Connectors Integration Wizard](t_create_integration_wizard.md#):** Each Data Connectors integration includes a Data Connectors Integration Wizard that steps customers through the process of integrating a partner application with Data Connectors. Data Connectors partners must identify the integration points between the application and Data Connectors, and gather the information necessary to construct the Data Connectors Integration Wizard.

**[Test the Integration](t_test_integration.md#):** Use the Data Connectors sandbox to test and refine the integration until it behaves just how you want it to.

**[Upload Data to Analytics](t_upload_to_Sitecatalyst.md#):** Once configured, the integration is ready to receive data from the partner application and insert it into the associated Analytics report suite.

**[Download Segmented Data](t_download_dw_segments.md#):** \(Optional\) Once data is uploaded to Analytics, you can retrieve data segments that include the partner data by using Data Warehouse.

# Sample Data Connectors Integration

Illustrates the process of creating a Data Connectors integration using the Data Connectors Partner API.

The registration process includes uploading an icon to represent the integration in the Data Connectors Network and Data Connectors Showcase. For examples or suitable product icons, visit the Data Connectors area in the Adobe Experience Cloud. The product icon must have the following characteristics:

-   High-quality image
-   88 X 28 pixels
-   Suitable for display on a white background \(the image background should be transparent\).
-   GIF \(`.gif`\) file format
-   Clearly identifies the integration using product and/or partner name.

Prior to starting the development process, you must apply and be approved as a Data Connectors partner. If you are not yet a Data Connectors partner, visit [http://www.omniture.com/en/partners/apply](http://www.omniture.com/en/partners/apply) for more information, or send an email to `partners@omniture.com`.

Once approved as a Data Connectors partner, register the new integration in the Partner Portal.

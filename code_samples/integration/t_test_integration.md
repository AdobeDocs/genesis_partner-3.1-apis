# To Test a Data Connectors Integration

1.   Log in to the Data Connectors sandbox, then open Data Connectors. 
2.   Drag and drop the Twitter integration icon to launch the Data Connectors Integration Wizard. 

    The Wizard steps you through the process of configuring the integration. This is the process a customer uses to activate the integration for their Analytics report suite.

    For the sample Twitter integration, this includes the following:

    -   Specify a name for the integration.
    -   Specify one or more Twitter search terms \(separate multiple search terms with a comma\).
    -   Select Analytics eVars to use with the Twitter metrics.
    -   Select a Analytics Event to store the number of tweets.
    -   Save the integration.

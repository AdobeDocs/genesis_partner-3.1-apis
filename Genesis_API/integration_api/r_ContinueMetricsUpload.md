# Import.ContinueMetricsUpload

Appends an additional data block to an existing Data Connectors data submission.

Individual data blocks can contain no more than 10,000 data rows \(to keep the HTTP POST below 10MB\), so you might need to break up data submissions into multiple data blocks.

## Import.ContinueMetricsUpload Parameters

|Parameter|Type|Required|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-----------|
|**integrationCode** |`xsd:string` | Yes| The integration identifier. Call [Partner.GetIntegrationAccess](r_getIntegrationAccess.md#) to get this value.|
|**blockId** |[colArray](../../data_types/r_datatype_colArray.md#) | Yes| The ID of the previous block sent for this data submission.

 Both [Import.UploadMetrics](r_uploadMetrics.md#) and `Import.ContinueMetricsUpload` returns `blockID` in its response, as long as `endOfBlock` is not included in the `UploadMetrics` call.|
|**endOfBlock** |`xsd:string` | No| A value of 1 indicates that this is the last block in the data submission. A value of 0 indicates that additional data will be sent.

 To indicate the end of a data block, pass the following:

`<endOfBlock>1</endOfBlock>.` To indicate that additional data will be sent, pass the following:

`<endOfBlock>0</endOfBlock>.` If you pass an `endOfBlock` with a value of `0`, you must continue to call this method \(ContinueMetricsUpload\) until you set end of block equal to 1.|

## Import.ContinueMetricsUpload Response

|Response|Type|Description|
|--------|----|-----------|
|**status** |`xsd:string` | Indicates if the call was successful. Valid return values include `Failed` or `Success`.

 If the call fails, Data Connectors returns an error message to help you understand why the call failed.|
|**fileId** |`xsd:int` | The unique ID generated by the Processing Queue to identify a particular Data Connectors data submission.

 This parameter is assigned a value only when the request does not include the `<endOfBlock/>` tag.|

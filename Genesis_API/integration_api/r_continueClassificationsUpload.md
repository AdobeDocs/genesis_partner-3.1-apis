# Import.ContinueClassificationsUpload

Appends an additional data block to an existing Data Connectors classifications submission.

Individual data blocks can contain no more than 10,000 data rows \(to keep the HTTP POST below 10MB\), so you might need to break up data submissions into multiple data blocks.

## Import.ContinueClassificationsUpload Parameters

|Parameter|Type|Required|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-----------|
|**integrationCode** |`xsd:string` | Yes| The integration identifier. Call [Partner.GetIntegrationAccess](r_getIntegrationAccess.md#) to get this value.|
|**blockId** |`xsd:int` | Yes| The ID of the previous block sent for this classifications submission.

 Both [Import.UploadClassifications](r_uploadClassifications.md#) and [Import.ContinueClassificationsUpload](r_continueClassificationsUpload.md#) return `blockID` in its response, as long as `endOfBlock` is not included in the call.|
|**rows** |[rowArray](../../data_types/r_datatype_rowArray.md#) | Yes| The classification data to import.

 The `rows` parameter should contain the same number of columns as specified in the `columnNames` parameter of the [Import.UploadClassifications](r_uploadClassifications.md#) call.|
|**endOfBlock** |`xsd:string` | No| A value of 1 indicates that this is the last block in the data submission. A value of 0 indicates that additional data will be sent.

 To indicate the end of a data block, pass the following:

`<endOfBlock>1</endOfBlock>.` To indicate that additional data will be sent, pass the following:

`<endOfBlock>0</endOfBlock>.` If you pass an `endOfBlock` with a value of `0`, you must continue to call this method \(ContinueClassificationsUpload\) until you set end of block equal to 1.|

## Import.ContinueClassificationsUpload Response

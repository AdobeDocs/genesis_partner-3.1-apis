# Security

The Suite ensures that access to your company information and transfer of data is secure. The Authentication procedure is based on the OASIS Web Services Security Username Token Profile 1.0 specification. This method utilizes a shared secret that can be renewed by an Adobe ClientCare at your request. This shared secret should never be passed over the Internet unencrypted.

In addition to secure authentication, the Data Connectors API supports secure transfer of data over an SSL data encryption layer. This method of Web services security is an industry standard and is built into the SOAP technology.

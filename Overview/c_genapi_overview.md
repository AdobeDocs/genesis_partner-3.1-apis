# Data Connectors Partner API

Data connectors make it possible to exchange data between partner applications and the Adobe Experience Cloud.

Data connectors let you activate an integration that exchanges data between the partner’s product or service and Suite collection servers. Once activated, the client can leverage the partner data in the Suite and export relevant data, such as re-marketing segments, back to the partner product or service.

The Data Connectors Partner API lets Adobe partners build these integrations for their clients.

**Note:** Only registered and approved Adobe Data Connectors partners have access to the partner tools. For information about becoming a partner, visit [http://www.omniture.com/en/partners/apply](http://www.omniture.com/en/partners/apply), or send an email to partners@omniture.com.

The Data Connectors Partner API provides SOAP and REST interfaces, and is comprised of two separate Web Services:

**Data Connectors Configuration API:** Lets the partner define the integration’s characteristics and the data that the partner wants to provide clients as part of the data exchange.

**Data Connectors Integration API:** Enables the day-to-day data transfer between the partner environment and Suite collection servers.
